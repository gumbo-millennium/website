# Contribution guide

So, you'd like to help with the Gumbo Millennium website? That's absolutely
AWESOME ðŸŽ‰!

This guide describes how to get started with developing the website. It should
be pretty hacktoberfest-proof (and, thusly, easy to use), so please create a
documentation issue if you can't figure out some parts of this guide.

## Required software

As we work on this site on a wide range of devices, we've decided to use some
software to ease our work, and to provide a consistent development experience
for all our users.

Therefore, the requirements for this project are a _tiny bit_ bigger when
comared to standard Laravel development (the addition of Docker, mainly). This
is to ensure all our users are able to work in a consistent,
production-mirroring environment.

These following requirements are for Linux, Mac OS and Windows:


- **PHP 7.4 or newer** - [Website][site-php] - We use the new [flexible
  Heredoc][heredoc] and arrow functions on some occasions, which doesn't work in PHP <7.3.
- **NodeJS** - [Website][site-nodejs] - We use Webpack for linting, compiling
  and optimizing the code, which runs in NodeJS
- **Composer** - [Website][site-composer] - We need a lot of dependencies
  (Laravel, to begin with) and Composer handles them.
- **Docker** - [Website][site-docker] - We use Docker to present an environment
  that matches the production servers.
- **Docker Compose** - [Website][site-docker-compose] - Docker compose provides
  sandboxed environments to deploy the Docker containers.

### Larvel Homestead and Laravel Valet

This project **does __not__ support** Laravel Homestead and Laravel Valet. We
use Docker in place of these systems, since they represent the server
environment more closely, work across all supported OS'es and since we don't
want to restrict easy development to just one (very expensive) platform.

### Windows users

**Turn off auto-CRLF**: We're expecting you to use a proper IDE (not Notepad).
Since CRLF and LF line-endings cause nothing more than trouble. `core.autocrlf`
needs to be set to `false`.

If you don't want to make this change locally, clone the repository like so:

```
git clone -o core.autocrlf=false https://github.com/gumbo-millennium/website.git
```

Lastly, the repository uses Docker to provide it's environment requirements,
like MySQL and Redis. We recommend to use the  [Windows Subsystem Linux][wsl]
for most of your work, as IDEs like Visual Studio Code support this natively
and it allows you to run the various shell scripts that exists in the
repository. All scripts are to be written in Bash, Powershell scripts won't be
accepted.

## Checking your shell

After installing all software, please make sure all commands that are required
for installation work. You can easily test this by running the following on the
command line:

- `composer -v`
- `php -v`
- `docker version` (Windows users an getting errors? [read this][wsl-docker])
- `docker-compose`

## Configuring Laravel Nova repository

This project uses Laravel Nova, a proprietary admin panel developed by the
Laravel team. This repo is behind authentication, which means you'll need a
login and password (or token) to login.

As the license only allows one developer, we cannot easily share the license.
If you have a zip file of nova, and want to test if something works, you can
put the Laravel Nova download (`^2.0`) as `nova.zip` in the root of the project,
and then run `composer install-nova-zip`.

## Clone the repository

Let's get you started by cloning the respository locally. As we're using some
repositories for creating dummy content, you're adviced to clone resursively:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/gumbo-millennium/website.git
```

or, if you're using the GitHub CLI:

```
gh repo clone gumbo-millennium/website -- --recursive
```

If you ran a normal, non-recursive clone, you can retroactively import the
missing test-components using `git submodule`:

```
git submodule update --init
```

### Go live

After all these checks, you can go live with your installation. We've set up a
command that runs all required steps for installation. It may take about 20
mins to complete, and only needs to be run once.

```
composer run contribute
```

After this command completes, go to <http://localhost:13370> to test it out.

Happy developing.

## Issue policy

When opening an issue, please consider the following:

1. Be sure to describe the issue in detail. Include demo code and/or
   screenshots if possible.
2. Mention your platform and relevant versions. As a minumum, mention your OS
   and PHP version (`php -v` is your friend here).
3. Don't be a dick.

## Pull request policy

When creating a policy file, please keep the following in mind:

1. Describe your changes, and if any tests are affected. If there's a relevant
   issue, mention that too.
2. When changing dependencies, also add their lockfiles (`composer.lock` for
   Composer, `package-lock.json` for Node)
3. Don't commit IDE-specific files (like the `.idea` folder), they often
   contain absolute paths, which won't work across systems.

If at all possible, please sign the last commit of your PR.
